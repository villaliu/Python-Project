The hardest parts of designing the game would be the tile placement and the game behavior realization. 
After consideration, I decide to use the class objects rather than procedural nesting because class objects
need less coding and save lots of space. 
I create 2 classes to help me coding the game. They are class Tile and class Counter. class Tile helps me to load
tiles onto screen and set their position, their image attached, swap them. class Tile implements tile placement 
and behavior. class Counter helps me to count how many times the user is swapping.
After finishing tile placement by utilizing class tile, I use a screenonclick help fuction to implement game rules
with class Counter.
For the leaderborad, I create a file called leaderboard and append to it each time a winner appears to keep track
of the winners. The leaderborad then will only load the latest four winner on the game. 


A note regarding my screensize:
on my screen,  if I use screen.setup, the turtle screen can not show completely and  will move to the 
top of my computer screen. After discussing the issue in the lab session with 2 TAs, I was suggested
to use screensize instead. It may result to scrolling all the time, but at least it works.
